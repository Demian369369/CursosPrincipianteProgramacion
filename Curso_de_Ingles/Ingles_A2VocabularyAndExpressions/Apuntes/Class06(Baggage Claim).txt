Depending which airport you will be landing at, you can get a taxi or a combination of a bus and then a taxi. For instance, If you land at Jorge Newbery Airport, which is located right in the centre of Buenos Aires, you can get a taxi to The Monumental, which is the River Plate Stadium and one of the largest in the country. It is pretty close to the airport actually. Otherwise, if you land at Ezeiza Airport, you will have to take a bus to Buenos Aires to take a taxi to the stadium once you get to the city. You can take a taxi from the airport too, but it would be considerably more expensive than the first alternative.
