How did this course help you?

It helped me to know common expressions and vocabulary in daily situations

What was the most interesting part of the course?

I think that the most interesting part of the course were the modules about the airport and the hotel because I'm learning English with the purpose of travel in the future and that knowledge will help me a lot. Thank you Ren√©

How will you put what you learned into practice?

I will practice in my future trips
